# Automatic Zoom Meetings
This project is written in response to the Covid-19 crisis and the decisions made by Bilkent University regarding the continuity of education 
ensured by online classroom meetings from Zoom application.

This project is an open-source project and I grant my permission for people to utilize this software for all non-illegal activities.

you can modify the code to provide the chrome driver from another specific location.
